                + "Collapsing buildings and fires following an earthquake are often the main causes of death. "

                + "All countries are vulnerable to natural hazards, but most of the 3.3 million deaths from disasters in the last 40 years have been in poorer nations. "
                + "Poor people are also the ones who suffer the greatest long-term consequences of disasters as they have no insurance and no means to recover quickly; "

                + "In industrialized countries, more women than men died during the 2003 European heatwave; many more African-American women were affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 than men. "
                + "In many countries, women have subordinate positions, restricted mobility, less educational opportunity, less voice in decision-making and poorer employment, all of which increases vulnerability. "
                + "During Hurricane Mitch in 1998, a disproportionate number of street children in Central America were affected. "

                + "Rich countries (United States, Europe, and increasingly Asia) incur greater absolute damage as the value of their infrastructure is higher. "
                + "The damage is least in Africa, where the poor possess little. The 2005 Indian Ocean tsunami cost US$10 billion whereas Hurricane Katrina cost more than US$130 billion in the United States. "
